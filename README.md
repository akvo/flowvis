Build
============
To install npm download the latest binaries from [here](http://nodejs.org/download/). If you might experiment with multiple versions of node installed on your system you can also try a node version manager like [NPM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [Nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave)

This project uses coffee-script. To install it use

`$ npm -g install coffee-script`

After making changes to the coffee script files found at - scripts/coffee/ compile using

`$ cake build`

View html/index.html to view the result

Links
============
The project uses the following tools:

* [ember](http://emberjs.org/)
* [ember-leaflet](https://github.com/gabesmed/ember-leaflet)
* [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
* [ember-data](http://emberjs.com/api/data/)
* [d3js](http://d3js.org/)
* [coffee-script](http://coffeescript.org/)

Useful links to help understand ember-data, leaflet and ember-leaflet.

* [Ember Guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/)
* [Ember Leaflet](http://gabesmed.github.io/ember-leaflet/)
* [Git Bundles](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3635952/how-to-use-git-bundle-for-keeping-development-in-sync)
* [D3 Tips & Tricks](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks)

For ember and ember data I found the best guide to be the [latest video tutorial for ember](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QHrlFlaXdI) and this [tutorial](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/07/an-in-depth-introduction-to-ember-js/)

But given how much ember has been changing lately the best documentation appears to be the source code for ember, ember-data and ember-leaflet. 
As well as a lot of code by trial and error.
